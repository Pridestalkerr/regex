# regex
Regex parsing implementation. 
The algorithm converts a regex into it's corresponding minimal DFA using Glushkov's Construction and bitmasking of states to achieve a good compromise between time and space efficiency. 

Will write a short documentation on the used algorithm as soon as I have some free time.
